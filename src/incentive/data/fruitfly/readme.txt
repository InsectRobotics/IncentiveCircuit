------------------------------------


The filenames contain information about the ROI, odour exposed and trial: "realSCREEN_{ROI}.xlsx_finaldata{odour}_timepoint{trial}.csv"
- ROI: MB{ROI} (e.g. MB005} identifies the position of the neuron from where the responses were recorded.
- Odour: Could be one of M+S (0.1% 4-methylcyclohexanol; MCH) or O (0.1% 3-octanol; OCT).
- Trial: The trial number of the experiment when the data were recorded

Columns:
- Each column represents a different fly

Rows:
- Each row represents a different time-step (total: 100)
- The data were recorded with 5 Hz frequency
